        "The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming competition in the world, often hailed as the \"World Cup of Programming.\" It is a team-based competition where university students work in teams of three to solve a set of complex algorithmic problems within a five-hour time limit. The contest fosters creativity, teamwork, and innovation in building new software programs and enables students to test their ability to perform under pressure."

        "In programming contests like the ICPC, the ranking of teams is determined by two main factors. The primary factor is the **total number of problems solved**; the team that solves the most problems ranks higher. If two or more teams solve the same number of problems, a tie is broken by the **total penalty time**. The team with the lower total penalty time is ranked higher. The penalty for a single solved problem is calculated as the time taken to solve it (in minutes from the start of the contest) plus a 20-minute penalty for each incorrect submission for that problem. For example, if a team solves a problem on their 3rd attempt at the 200-minute mark, the penalty for that problem will be 200 + (2 Ã— 20) = 240. Importantly, *teams do not incur any penalty for problems they did not solve, regardless of how many incorrect attempts they made.*"
